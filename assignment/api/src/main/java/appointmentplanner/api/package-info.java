/**
 * Library to facilitate planning of appointments.
 * 
 * The model is about the planning per day, in the form of a time range or time slot with start time and duration.
 * 
 * Since v1.0 there is an official API to provide more freedom to the implementer.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This is a student project. The implementation can be tested by a separate test project, by implementing the 
 * necessary infrastructure for the java service provider api.
